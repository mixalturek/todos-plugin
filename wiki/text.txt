{info:title=Important}
This plugin is fully functional and pretty usable but it is NOT an official Jenkins plugin. It wasn't accepted by the Jenkins team, because it partially duplicates functionality of already existing [JENKINS:Task Scanner Plugin]. The consequences are that Jenkins project infrastructure can't be used for releases, Jenkins Update Center for installation and updates, Jenkins Jira to track possible issues or feature requests and header of this wiki page to track all meta information including a size of user base.

Please use [SourceForge.net infrastructure of TODOs project|http://sourceforge.net/projects/todos/] to ask questions, create feature request or bug reports.

h1. Configuration

Configuring the plugin should be self-explanatory. You simply need to generate [TODOs XML report|http://todos.sourceforge.net/manual.html] and activate TODOs publisher in the project configuration page. Add the path to report files you would like to use and save the configuration. Then the next build will report the comments that were found and the second build will show the trend.

{code}
# Minimal configuration, analyze current directory
todos.sh --out-xml todos.xml

# Output also 5 lines of context, analyze all source directories
todos.sh --after-context 5 --out-xml todos.xml src*

# Optionally rewrite existing output file, ignore some directories
todos.sh --force --suppressed .git build dist --after-context 5 --out-xml todos.xml .
