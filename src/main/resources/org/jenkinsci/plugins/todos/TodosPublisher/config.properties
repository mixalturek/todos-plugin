description.pattern=<a href="{0}">ANT fileset "includes"</a> setting that \
	specifies the generated XML TODOs report files - such as "<code>**/todos.xml</code>". \
	Base directory of the fileset is <a href="ws/">the workspace root</a>. \
	If no value is set, then the default "<code>**/todos.xml</code>" will be used. Be sure not \
	to include any non-report files into this pattern. The report files must \
	have been generated by \
	<a href="http://todos.sourceforge.net/">TODOs utility</a> \
	using at least the following \
	"<code><a href="http://todos.sourceforge.net/manual.html">todos.sh --out-xml todos.xml</a></code>" \
	options.
